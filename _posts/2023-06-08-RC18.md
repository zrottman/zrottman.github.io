Today was slightly abridged since [my boy is sick](http://myboyissick.com/), but did manage to get a few things done:
- paired a bit on C for BYOL
- continued my battle with a LeetCode brain-melter of a linked list problem
- had a great coffee chat
- worked on some SICP exercises and generally feeling grateful that next week we're moving on from the math-heavy algos. Not that I dislike them -- it's just that they take me a while.
