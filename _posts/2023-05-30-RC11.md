Today we're going to bring our adder across the finish line.

[Last time](https://www.datadoodad.com/recurse%20center/RC10/) we derived a full adder that required six gates in the end:
- 2 `XOR` gates
- 2 `OR` gates
- 2 `AND` gates

[As I demo'ed in another post](https://www.datadoodad.com/recurse%20center/RC06/), each of these gates can be derived from `NAND` gates exclusively. 
- An `OR` gate can be built from 3 `NAND` gates, 
- an `AND` from 2, 
- and an `XOR` -- by far the most expensive of all -- from 9 `NAND` gates, which can easily be reduced to 5.

That means our full adder would need 20 `NAND` gates. But after drawing it out, I noticed a few opportunities for savings and eventually got it down to 15 `NAND`s. Maybe it can be simplified further, I'm not sure.

Anyway. 15 `NAND` gates, then. But that's just for adding two bits and a carry bit. Fun fact: If we want to add two 16-bit integers, we'd need 240 `NAND` gates!

Well, we're not insane, so we're going to make do with the `Full Adder` abstraction, of which we need one for each bit -- i.e., 16 are needed for adding 16-bit integers. Even that's a lot, though, so here's how it'd all look for a 4-bit adder:

What's happening here is that the Least Significant Bits (the bits in the 1's place, or bits $$a_0$$ and $$b_0$$) get passed into the `a` and `b` inputs of the first adder. Because there's no carry bit for the first adder, we can pull $$c_0$$ to ground. This first adder has the two outputs we expect: our least signficant sum bit $$y_0$$ and carry bit $$c_1$$, which belongs with the next most significant bit in the 2's place.

Speaking of: Next we indeed move on to the next most significant bits -- the bits in the 2's place, or bits $$a_1$$ and $$b_1$$, which we pass to the `a` and `b` inputs of the second adder along with the $$c_1$$ carry bit output from the first adder. This second adder spits out a sum bit for the 2's place, $$y_1$$ and a carry bit for the 4's place, $$c_2$$.

On and on we go. The input bits from the 4's place, $$a_2$$ and $$b_2$$, go to adder number 3, which give us sum bit $$y_2$$ and carry bit $$c_3$$, then then the input bits from the 8's place, $$a_3$$ and $$b_3$$, go to adder number 4, which gives us sum bit $$y_3$$ and carry bit $$c_4$$, which actually becomes our overflow sum bit $$y_4$$ since there's no more adders left.

If we want to add 8-bit integers or 16-bit integers, well, we just need more adders chained along! But that's the main idea.

# Other things that happened today
- Did some pairing on a string problem from CTCI
- Had a few good coffee chats, including with a recurser about their workflow with Obsidian (a markdown knowledge manager) and Anki (a flashcard software). Very impressed but not sure I have the discipline for Anki. However, I was very curious about Obsidian, since I've been keen to move away from DevonThink, which suited me during the days of dissertation research but not feels a little heavy-weight and opaque. Still, I'm not sure that moving to Obsidian is the answer right now, as attractive as writing in markdown is. So, kicking that can down the road.
- Did a linked list cycle detection problem in the Neetcode group
- Paired with a fellow nand2tetris groupie where we hammed out an ALU, which will be the subject of my next blog post. It was genuinely a surprise when our ALU suddenly worked, really a fun and productive collaborative effort.
