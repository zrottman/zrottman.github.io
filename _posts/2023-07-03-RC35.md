I've been curious to do a little tinkering with the OpenAI API since early on in batch, when a fellow recurser casually demo'ed a GPT pipeline and suddenly all was demystified, but I never got around to it. And then last week another recurser showed off a project involving multiple LLM and stable diffusion pipelines. So today I let loose.

Maybe it would be cool, I thought, to run a Google search and then scrape each of the results and have GPT summarize the text from each hit? This is redundant on the one hand, since, if it's summaries of popular or relevant websites that you want, just asking ChatGPT would be easier. But what if you wanted GPT to be able to summarize more recent material from after it was trained? I figured this way you can run your search and get a quick survey of Google's top hits before deciding whether to click through. As an added bonus, this prototype preserves the source of the summary in the form of the origin URL, so you have a citation if you want (I do).

Totalling a couple dozen lines of code, this program
- takes as a CLI argument the search query
- uses `requests` to get the JSON-formatted results of the search using the Google API
- parses the JSON response and loops through each of the hits, extracting the text with BeautifulSoup
- passes the lightly cleaned page text to the OpenAI API along with some system messages specifying a request for a summary of the page text in light of the original query
- prints GPT-3.5's results to stdout

I mean... Am I ever going to use this to perform a search? Of any kind? Nope. It's definitely tedious and annoying and not worth the pennies each search costs. But, the exercise served its purpose, and my toes are now wet.
