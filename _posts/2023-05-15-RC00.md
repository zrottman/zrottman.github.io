  Daily logs of my 12 weeks at the Recurse Center in Summer 2023

Well, that's day 0, then.
<!--more-->
- Attended orientation
- Proceeded to feel mostly disoriented through no fault of the awesome orientators
- Meandering about the flatland that is Virtual RC, found and claimed a virtual desk, my own lil' piece of the grid
- Paired a little on another recurser's kaggle project, and understood immediately why pairing is where it's at
- Wrote, compiled, and executed a C++ "Hello World" program and wondered, for a weirdly long time, if C++ really is my destiny. Is it?
- Interacted with folks on the message board (not an insigificant step!), and, well, turns out C may be my more immediate destiny. Felt some relief.

Overall, feeling like I don't have a lot to show for myself except spiraling eyeballs and a virtual desk with my initials on it, but, hey, maybe that's a decent start.

But perhaps things are coming into focus. One helpful recursor recommended Kernighan and Ritchie's *The C Programming Language*, which mercifully is not very long (8 main chapters, <200 pages). Coming into view as a goal for the week is to tackle the first two chapters and write something that does something and then see, I mean C, where things stand.
