This short post has nothing to do with `char`s or pointers (I couldn't resist). It does, however, have to do with walruses -- walrus operators, to be exact.

The walrus operator (`:=`) looks walrus-y. It's a thing I've known exists and have probably looked up and then forgotten about a dozen times. Yesterday it came up again while working on [Implement DNS in a Weekend](https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/), and now I'm going to write about it, and by virtue of doing so I will never have to look the walrus operator up again.

# So, the walrus operator.

Normally, you might assign a variable in Python like so:

```python
x = 10      # Step 1: Assign
```

and then evaluate it in a REPL like so:

```python
x           # Step 2: Evaluate
```
    
    10

Or perhaps you prefer to assign and then print using the `print()` function:

```python
x = 15      # Step 1: Assign
print(x)    # Step 2: Evaluate
```

    15

The walrus operator allows you to assign and evaluate in a single step. That's it.

```python
(y := 100)  # Steps 1 and 2: Assign and evaluate!
```

    100

Or:

```python
print(z := "O Oysters, come and walk with us!") # Assign and evaluate!
```

    O Oysters, come and walk with us!

You would never read a file like this, but here's another walrus in the wild:

```python
while ((line := f.readline()) and line != '\n'):
    print(line)
```

    The sun was shining on the sea,

        Shining with all his might:

    He did his very best to make

        The billows smooth and brightâ€”

    And this was odd, because it was

        The middle of the night.
