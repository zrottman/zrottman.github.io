This short post has nothing to do with `char`s or pointers (I couldn't resist). It does, however, have to do with walruses -- walrus operators, to be exact.

Like the Dall-e hallucination above, the walrus operator (`:=`) looks ... sort of walrus-y. It's a thing I've known exists and have probably looked up and then forgotten about a dozen times. Yesterday it came up again while working on [Implement DNS in a Weekend](https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/). Now I'm going to write about it, and by virtue of doing so I will never have to look the walrus operator up again.

# The Walrus . . .

Normally, you might assign a variable in Python like so:

```python
x = 10      # Step 1: Assign
```

and then evaluate it in a REPL like so:

```python
x           # Step 2: Evaluate
```
    
    10

Or perhaps you prefer to assign and then print using the `print()` function:

```python
x = 15      # Step 1: Assign
print(x)    # Step 2: Evaluate
```

    15

The walrus operator allows you to assign and evaluate in a single step. That's it.

```python
(y := 100)  # Steps 1 and 2: Assign and evaluate!
```

    100

Or:

```python
print(z := "O Oysters, come and walk with us!") # Assign and evaluate!
print(z)
```

    O Oysters, come and walk with us!
    O Oysters, come and walk with us!

# . . . and the Char Pointer

I guess the reference to `char`s and pointers is not wholy irreievalt, since the walrus operator turns out to enable very C-like syntax. In C, for instance, it is very natural to do something like this:

```c
while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
    // do stuff with `c`
}
```

In this case we're assignining `c` and evaluating the assignment expression in one go, so that `c` can be be used as a component of the predicate `c != EOF`. 

While you would probably never read a file like this in Python, you could approximate this C-style syntax using the walrus:

```python
while ((line := f.readline()) != '\n'):
    print(line)
```

    The sun was shining on the sea,

        Shining with all his might:

    He did his very best to make

        The billows smooth and brightâ€”

    And this was odd, because it was

        The middle of the night.

As another example, in C you could do things like this:

```c
    int i = 0;
    char s[] = "The time has come";

    printf("%c\n", s[i]);           // s[0] => T
    printf("%c\n", s[++i]);         // s[1] => h
    printf("%c\n", s[(i += 1)]);    // s[2] => e
```

    T
    h
    e

`++i` and `(i += 1)` both increment `i` and evaluate to new `i` in one go. You could walrus it up to accomplish a similar feat in Python:

```python
s = "Of shoes and ships and sealing wax"
i = 0

print(s[i])
print(s[(i := i + 1)])
print(s[(i := i + 1)])
print(s[(i := i + 1)])
```

    O
    f

    s


# Other goings on

- Coffee-chat hat trick. Three damn fine coffee chats with a bunch of damn fine folks who are alums or in the last week of batch, all of whom offered some welcome perspective for someone at the halfway-point moment of reckoning. As a group the convos left me with the abiding sense that it's okay not to build a React app or do whatever thing seems the most portfolio-ready.
- Continued on to Part 2 (which turned out to be Part 1 of Part 2) of the DNS project. Appreciating this introduction to all things DNS, which is piquing my curiosity about other network-y things.
- Spent a while redrawing [CPU diagrams](https://www.datadoodad.com/recurse%20center/RC26/) and talked CPU implementations at weekly nand2tetris meeting
