I spent a lot of time today drawing out various logic gates schematics. Too much time. I hadn't known that `NAND` logic is so magical and that it's possible to derive all other logic gates from combinations of `NAND`s, but now that I do I can't get enough `NAND`.

Besides drawing logic diagrams, the other thing I started today was SICP.

Actually, before I cracked the book I had to get my Scheme environment up and running. One of my group mates recommended [DrRacket](https://download.racket-lang.org/releases/8.9/doc/drracket/index.html) which allows you to [run the version of Scheme used in the SICP book](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/). But I ended up going [MIT/GNU Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/), which thus far suits me. Is it because of the Latin sign-offs when halting with `(exit)`? I won't say. All I know is that, between the sorcery talk ("In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells") and the calamitous quips from Cato the Elder ("Furthermore, I consider that Carthage must be destroyed"), I'm feeling like I've just embarked on a proper quest.

Here's what else happened:
- Checkins
- Finished first week's problem set for #nand2tetris
- Became so enmeshed in drawing logic diagrams that I was late to a meeting with an RC career counselor, who encouraged my near-term plans
- Made it through almost two LeetCode problems with the Neetcode group
- Met some new folks
